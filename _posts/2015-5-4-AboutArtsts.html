<p>Raised in a buddhist family, YANG received Aesthetics Design training at Beijing Science and Technology University.  An Applied Mathematician hailed from Berkeley, California, ZHENZHEN conducted behavioral science research, focusing on biased decision making process.</p>

<p>In 2013, the two met at the INTERACTIVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM (ITP) at Tisch School of Art in New York City, and embarked on a journey of cross-pollinating Art, Science, and Technology.</p>

<p>The duo quickly became fascinated by employing new media technologies such as mindwave sensor, breath sensor, and Virtual Reality headsets to create alternative experiences thatâ€™s slightly surreal, where patterns are shifted, expectations are removed, and participants start to become aware of their less conscious self.</p>
