From a technical perspective, finding body sensors that are wearible, stable, and aligned with the conceptual idea of the project is key. We started testing a variety of body sensors that could potentially be a good fit. 

EEG:

Breath: 

GSR: 




Second: the recorded data set was used as the basis for the generative aspects of the personalized wearable couture. The output is an abstract 3D mesh armature of my location data points collected over about a month. The dataset was fed into processing to produce the pattern and exported to Rhino to make the 3D mesh.

Lastly, the mobile app and server is used to provide real-time data transmission through bluetooth to an Arduino, which controls reactive displays that change in opacity to reveal the wearerâ€™s skin. This occurs in proportion to the volume of information that is passively generated.
