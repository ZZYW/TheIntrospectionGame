<h1>THE INTROSPECTION GAME 5/21-5/29</h1>
<h3>VISUALIZING BIOFEEDBACK THROUGH DIGITAL NARRITIVE</h3>

<img class="img-responsive" id="main-image" src="{{ "/img/outsidelogo.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
<p>OPENING THURSDAY, MAY 21st, 8 - 11PM, THE LABORTORY will present an interactive, experimental art installation that employs novel technologies to mediate, augment and echo our experience of the world around us. The effect is trans-sensory—as breaths become sunlights and oceanwaves—as heart beats become both audible and visible. The result, is a strange new narrative manifested by one's own body.</p>

<p>THE INSTROSPECTION GAME, which new media artists YANG WANG and ZHENZHEN QI developed at the LABORATORY incubator, is an investigation into a new form of self speculation. Participants are invited into an empty room one at time, wearing a breath sensor waistband, a pause sensor, and a 3D head-mount. Once the Virtual Reality algorithm starts, the participant is temporarily teleported into a virtual world resembling the empty room he/she sits in. Depending on the breathing pattern, the participant embarks on a journey that’s slightly surreal, descending through giant industrial wastes and building blocks, bypassing waves of jittering particles submerging from underground, and flying through an infinite ocean manifested by his/her own heart beats and breaths. Temporarily rearranging causes and effects, THE INTROSPECTION GAME alludes to the participants’ understanding about themselves.</p>

<p>THE LABORATORY is located at 301 W. Main street, Spokane, Washington.<br>
