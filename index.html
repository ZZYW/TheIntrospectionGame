<p>A poetic narrative generated by your own body, The Introspection Game sends you to a journey within, using Oculus Rift, a breath sensor, and a pulse sensor. 
Participants are invited into an empty room one at time, wearing a breath sensor waistband, a pulse sensor, and an Oculus 3D head-mount. Once the Virtual Reality experience starts, the participant is temporarily teleported into a virtual space resembling the actual room he/she sits in. Depending on the breathing pattern, the participant gradually descends upon a land surrounded by infinite ocean. As breaths become sunlights and ocean waves, heart beats become both audible and visible, the participants gradually start to direct their attention inwards, becoming aware of less obvious body senses.

<p>As New Media Artists growing up under the influence of east asian philosophy, Yang and Zhenzhen have been fascinated by body as a medium of self knowledge. By connecting breath and heart beat with a slightly shifted narrative, the Introspection Game is an investigation into a new way of self speculation, which attempts to mediates, augment, and evolve our experience with the world around us.
