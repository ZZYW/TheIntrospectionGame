<h1>THE INTROSPECTION GAME 5/21-5/29</h1>
<h3>EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN DIGITAL STORYTELLING AND BIOFEEDBACK</h3>




<blockquote>
<h5>And what is the purpose of writing music? … The answer must take the form of a paradox: a purposeful purposelessness or a purposeless play. This play, however, is an affirmation of life—not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we’re living, which is so excellent once one gets one’s mind and one’s desires out of its way and lets it act of its own accord.</h5>

<p>OPENING THURSDAY, MAY 21st, 8 - 11PM, THE LABORTORY will present an interactive, experimental art installation that employs novel technologies to mediate, augment and echo our experience of the world around us. The effect is trans-sensory—as breaths become sunlights and oceanwaves—as heart beats become both audible and visible. The result, is a strange new narrative manifested by one's own body.</p>

<p>THE INSTROSPECTION GAME, which new media artists YANG WANG and ZHENZHEN QI developed at the LABORATORY incubator, is an investigation into a new form of self speculation. Participants are invited into an empty room one at time, wearing a breath sensor waistband, a pause sensor, and a 3D head-mount. Once the Virtual Reality algorithm starts, the participant is temporarily teleported into a virtual world resembling the empty room he/she sits in. Depending on the breathing pattern, the participant embarks on a journey that’s slightly surreal, descending through giant industrial wastes and building blocks, bypassing waves of jittering particles submerging from underground, and flying through an infinite ocean manifested by his/her own heart beats and breaths. Temporarily rearranging causes and effects, THE INTROSPECTION GAME alludes to the participants’ understanding about themselves.</p>

<p id="aboutartists"><strong>ABOUT THE ARTISTS</strong></p>
<p>Raised in a buddhist family, Yang received Aesthetics Design training at Beijing Science and Technology University.  An Applied Mathematician hailed from Berkeley, California, Zhenzhen conducted behavioral science research, focusing on biased decision making process.</p>

<p>In 2013, the two met at the Interaction Design program at Tisch School of Art in New York City, and embarked on a journey of cross-pollinating Art, Science, and Technology.</p>

<p>The duo quickly became fascinated by employing new media technologies such as mindwave sensor, breath sensor, and Virtual Reality headsets to create alternative experiences that’s slightly surreal, where patterns are shifted, expectations are removed, and participants start to become aware of their less conscious self.</p>
